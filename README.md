# OQLA

## Introduction
OQLA is an AI personal coach that uses computer vision technology to detect correct exercise positions in real-time. It leverages Mediapipe for accuracy and Streamlit for a user-friendly interface. The project aims to provide users with instant feedback on their exercise form and a dashboard analysis of their performance.

## Background
OQLA addresses the challenge of maintaining proper exercise form. This project is important for promoting safe and effective exercise practices, benefiting fitness enthusiasts and beginners by providing real-time feedback.

## Objectives
To achieve this, OQLA aims to:
- Detect exercise forms in real-time.
- Accurately identify correct and incorrect forms.
- Develop a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
- Provide users with a dashboard analysis of their performance.

## Data Sources
We collected a dataset consisting of images from Pinterest and Google. These images were annotated for training the model to accurately recognize and evaluate exercise positions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Images were sourced from Pinterest and Google, annotated for correct forms.
2. **Model Training**: Mediapipe's pose estimation was utilized to train the model to recognize specific exercise positions.
3. **User Interface Development**: Streamlit was used to develop an interactive and user-friendly interface for real-time exercise form detection and performance visualization.
4. **Real-Time Detection**: The application was designed to detect exercise forms in real-time using a live camera feed.
5. **Performance Analysis**: A dashboard was created to provide users with a brief summary of their performance, including the number of correct movements detected during exercises.

## Results
The developed application successfully detected correct forms for various exercises in real-time. The Streamlit interface provided an intuitive platform for users to interact with the application and view their performance metrics. The dashboard offered valuable insights into user performance, highlighting areas of improvement and ensuring users could correct their form immediately.

## Conclusion
OQLA utilized Mediapipe's cutting-edge computer vision technology to offer real-time user performance and feedback, improving training experiences and encouraging fitness enthusiasts to follow safer, more efficient workout regimens.
